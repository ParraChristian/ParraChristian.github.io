# WIG Concept for Titan Exploration

## Project Overview
The Wing-in-Ground (WIG) Effect Aircraft project explored the feasibility of using ground-effect flight for planetary exploration on Titan.
The fixed-wing concept was developed through aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, and stability analyses, ensuring both performance and mission
viability. With defined requirements of a 450 kg dry mass and a >10 km range, the design achieved an estimated 41 km flight capability. The vehicle
concept also incorporated a robust scientific payload, including a mass spectrometer, gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, geophysics and meteorology 
package, and camera suite, enabling diverse data collection for planetary science.

##Features
Wing In Ground Effect
<br/>- Flying close to the ground reduces wingtip vortices and increases pressure underneath wings. 
Folding Wings
<br/>- Wings fold inwards to be able to fit in a 4.5m diameter aeroshell.
Wheels
<br/>- Aluminum Alloy 7075 - high fatigue resistance and maintains mechanical properties at low temperatures.
Tail
<br/>- V tail design reduces turbulence which is important for WIG effects
Insulation
<br/>- ultilayer Insulation (MLI) System
