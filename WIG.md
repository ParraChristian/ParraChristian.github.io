# WIG Concept for Titan Exploration

## Project Overview
This project explored the feasibility of using the Wing In Ground effect of fced wing aircraft for planetary exploration on Titan.
The fixed-wing concept was developed through aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, and stability analyses, ensuring both performance and mission
viability. With defined requirements of a 450 kg dry mass and a >10 km range, the design achieved an estimated 41 km flight capability. The vehicle
concept also incorporated a robust scientific payload, including a mass spectrometer, gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, geophysics and meteorology 
package, and camera suite, enabling diverse data collection for planetary science.

<br/> •  Withstand cold temp(94K) and dense atmosphere(4.5kg/m3)

## Subsystems
### Propulsion
Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (~75W)
<br/>• Provides thermal heat to internal systems

<br/>High-Density Battery
<br/>• 100Wh/kg
<br/>• 140kg
<br/>• 14kWh

<br/>Electric Motor powered Propellers
<br/>• 2 small under wing - 10.5kW(each)
<br/>• 1 large on nose - 60kW

### Data Collection
<br/>• Mass Spectrometer
<br/>• Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer
<br/>• Geophysics/Meteorology Package
<br/>• Camera Suite

## Features
### Wing In Ground Effect
Flying close to the ground reduces wingtip vortices and increases pressure underneath wings, reducing drag. 
### Folding Wings
Wings fold inwards to be able to fit in a 4.5m diameter aeroshell.
### Wheels
Aluminum Alloy 7075 - high fatigue resistance and maintains mechanical properties at low temperatures.
### Tail
V tail design reduces turbulence which is important for WIG effects
### Insulation
Multilayer Insulation (MLI) System
