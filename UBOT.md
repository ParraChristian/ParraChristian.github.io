# Mobile Manipulation Capstone

## Overview
•	Created software that planned a trajectory for the end-effector of a youBot mobile manipulator 
(a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm). <br/>
•	This software calculates odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot 
 to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and place it.
